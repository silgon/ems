# Emoji Search Bash (EMS)
This is a small script I decided to make because I needed some emojis (also because I spend most of my time in the shell).



This is inspired on [wofi-emoji](https://github.com/Zeioth/wofi-emoji). Actually, it was me trying to use it and I realized i needed wayland (which I do not want). I read the code and I created this small repo.
