# Emoji Search Bash (EMS)
This is a small script I decided to make because I needed some emojis (also because I spend most of my time in the shell).

## Installation

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://github.com/silgon/ems/raw/main/starter.sh)
```

The dependencies are `jq` and `xclip`. The script will try to install them if possible.


This is inspired on [wofi-emoji](https://github.com/Zeioth/wofi-emoji). Actually, it was me trying to use it and I realized i needed wayland (which I do not want). I read the code and I created this small repo.
